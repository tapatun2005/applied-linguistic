                            <p>This book explores the mechanics of storytelling within a study aimed at focusing on a ‘hidden’ population of migrants in the city of York, UK. Taking applied linguistics to mean the consideration of real-world ‘problems’ as identified by a ‘client’, in which the use of (and beliefs about) language is a significant component, the authors describe the benefits and challenges of working in a partnership with a community organisation. With project participants from Africa, Europe, Asia and South and Central America who had lived in York between two and fifty years, the study considers the co-construction of meaning in interviews from a range of practical and theoretical perspectives. The book will be of interest to students, academic researchers and community project leaders who are interested in migration stories and interviews as a method of data collection.</p>
