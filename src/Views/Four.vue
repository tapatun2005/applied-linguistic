              <h3>Why interview?</h3>
              <p>In part four, we ask ‘why interview?’ and present a framework that classifies some possible answers to this question into the following four categories: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Neo-positivist </li>
                <li>Romantic </li>
                <li>Constructionist </li>
                <li>Transformative </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In chapter one of our book, York’s Hidden Stories: Interviews in Applied Linguistics, we asked this question. In the text below we try and answer the question, and then sort our answers to this question into the four categories listed above. </p>
              <p>While you are reading the extract below, think about the ways in which interviews could be a product of the interaction between human (and non-human) participants? How might our thinking about the boundaries between humans (and non-humans) be challenged by these kinds of insights into interaction?  </p>

                    <h3>Why interview? </h3>
                    
                    <p>In the next part of this section, we consider a range of different ways of thinking about interviews and how these different conceptualisations of the genre might influence a researcher’s reasons for interviewing. We have already noted how frequently interviews are to be found in everyday life and in academic research; they are generally thought to be useful, flexible, easy to organise and fun. Underpinning the idea that interviews are ‘useful’ are a wide range of assumptions about the ‘content’ they generate and the way in which this content gets generated, the role of the interviewer and other aspects of the interview (for example, place and recording equipment), and the status of the interviewee as a person that can be separated both from the interviewer and from the context in which the interview takes place. Of them many possible ways of thinking about interviews, we have selected four to look at in some detail, and we very briefly mention a number of others for readers who may be interested in exploring these.  The four conceptualisations we explore here are: neo-positivist, romantic, constructionist and transformative. We have chosen these four because they are also the focus of a special issue of Applied Linguistics (Volume 32, Issue 1, 2011) that remains an important marker in the development of interview research in applied linguistics. In the next chapter of this book, we show how these four ways of thinking about interviews played out in the analysis of the interview data collected for the community project that forms the case study presented here. The brief mentions of other approaches aim to point at potential future directions for interview research.  </p>
                    
                    <p>If interviews are ‘obviously’ useful, flexible, easy to do and (maybe) fun, why should we (community activists or academic researchers) bother to think in any further detail about why we are using them to do our work? Methods of data collection and analysis have themselves become topics for discussion in the research literature, with users explaining what their preferred methods can be used to achieve and advising other users not to be inconsistent (for example, Talmy, 2010), or to misunderstand or confuse methods and the reasons for their use (for example, Braun and Clarke, 2019). In participating in the community project that we present here, we noticed that our own reasons for doing interviews (and therefore our understanding of the meaning and possible uses of interview data) were different from (what we understood of) the project leaders’, and maybe the participants’, reasons and understandings. These differences seemed like more than just different beliefs about the same ‘thing’, but like beliefs about different things. Thinking about these things became part of our study. We say more about why they did in the section below on the disciplinary context of our study. As we say above, the four conceptualisations we explore in this chapter are: neo-positivist, romantic, constructionist and transformative. We begin with the first two; both underpinned by the idea of the interview as a research instrument (Talmy, 2010). </p>
                    
                    <p>Neo-positivist reasons for choosing to interview are related to the assumption that interviews are an effective way of generating detailed accounts of events or thorough descriptions/explanations of beliefs and actions. Where the purpose of an interview is to uncover an accurate and detailed account, the interviewer is likely to consider themselves a neutral figure who, through careful preparation, aims to ask ‘good’ questions which reduce, or remove, bias in their findings. In this way, it is assumed, the interviewer produces good quality data that, in its straightforward relationship to the questions asked, is ‘valid’. According to Briggs (2007:555), researchers working in this tradition commonly portray interviews as carefully structured to ‘elicit inner worlds with minimal intervention’. This approach to interviewing is one which seeks to ‘mine the attitudes, beliefs and experiences of self-disclosing respondents’ (Talmy and Richards, 2010) who have been made to ‘forget about the [interview] event so that interviewers can access their ‘natural’ behaviour’ (De Fina and Perrino, 2011:1). Interview responses are thus assumed to be, and presented as, direct representations of people’s thoughts and experiences (Silverman, 2013). This rationale for interviews has been described as ‘you ask they answer, and then you know’ (Hollway, 2005:312). </p>
                    
                    <p>Another version of these beliefs is that interviews are thought to be/presented as a way of generating ‘true confessions’; self-revelations about thoughts, actions, and attitudes to events, which would not be possible without the empathetic skill of the interviewer. Where the interviewer aims to access ‘true confessions’, they are required to actively establish a positive rapport with the interviewee, allowing for an intimate conversation that provides insight into the authentic life-world of the interviewee. In contrast, establishing such a relationship is not likely to be part of the practice of interviews that are conducted for the reasons described in the previous paragraph. Those interviewers who aim to elicit detailed and accurate accounts are more likely to try not to create any kind of relationship with their interviewees, in the belief that a lack of neutrality could introduce bias into their data and undermine the validity of their findings. In a taxonomy of uses for and beliefs about interviews, Roulston (2010:51) categorises interviews that are undertaken for ‘neutral’ reasons as ‘neo-positivist’ and interviews undertaken for confessional reasons as ‘romantic’. Both neutral and confessional reasons for interviewing are ‘naturalistic’ (Silverman, 2004:iii) in the sense that the interviewers aim to document in detail the ‘real’ world of the interviewees in ways that, for example, questionnaires (lack of detail/depth) and observations (no access to the thinking of the participants) cannot.  </p>
                    
                    <p>In contrast to these neo-positivist/romantic ways of thinking about interviews, a constructionist perspective treats the interview as a socially-situated ‘speech event’ (Talmy and Richards, 2010:2) which actively shapes the participation of both interviewer and interviewee. This is an orientation to interviewing which understand interviews not as a ‘neutral’ research instrument but as a form of social practice’ Constructionist conceptualisations of interviews recognise the interactional context of the interviewee’s responses and treat these, not as direct representations of the interviewee’s thoughts and experiences but, as ‘situated accountings’ (Roulston, 2010:62). Holstein and Gubrium (2000 and 2004) similarly suggest that interviews should always be thought of as active meaning-making ventures in which it is not possible to divide the interviewer’s input and the participant’s interpretations. As Mann (2011:6) says, ‘all interviews are already sites of social interaction, where ideas, facts, views, details, and stories are collaboratively produced by interviewee and interviewer’. On interview questions, Clark and Schober say the following: </p>

                    <blockquote>It is futile to search for truly neutral questions. They don’t exist. Every question carries presuppositions, so every question establishes a perspective. So for each question we must ask: Is the perspective taken really the one from which we want the respondent to answer? If the answer is yes – if we can justify the perspective – then we can also justify the question. (Clark and Schober, 1992:30) </blockquote>

                    <p>In summary, a constructionist approach assumes that interviews do not stand for anything other than themselves, and that interview data can only tell us about how the participants ‘do’ interviewing at the time of their interaction. A constructionist approach, however, does allow us to observe the mechanics of how actual life stories get made and distributed, and, if we wish, to speculate on the possible consequences of these life stories for the interviewees.</p>

                    <p>We have presented three main ways of thinking about interviews: neo-positivist/romantic and constructionist. After Roulston (2010), we are calling our fourth and final category ‘transformative’. Transformative conceptualisations of interviews take as a starting point the belief that neo-positivist/romantic (and perhaps some constructionist) approaches fail to pay sufficient attention to the complexities of our gendered, socially and ethnically stratified world, and of our own thinking and writing. Highlighting the form of the word itself, Schostak says,  </p>

                    <blockquote>The inter-view maps what is at stake in the multiplicity of views that create the everyday fields of struggle. […] What is worth fighting for, arguing for, building, emerges through the inter-view, the dialogue of the views of people who seek recognition and representation of their differences. (Schostak, 2006:178) </blockquote>

                    <p>From a transformative perspective, the act of interviewing is underpinned by an awareness of the complex relationship between interviewer and interviewee. The participants in the act work jointly to develop new understandings of their experiences and challenge normative interpretations. The participants may also aim to use their interview data and any discussion of their findings to benefit the interviewees, by raising awareness of aspects of their lives or challenging interpretations of their experience in order to change public attitudes and, perhaps, government policy or law. Marn and Wolgemuth (2017:365) sum up this approach to interviews as follows, ‘transformative interviewers assume that all human interaction is interventional in some way and therefore seek to conduct interviews to intervene with intention.’ </p>

                    <p>So far, we have considered four ways of thinking about interviews (neo-positivist, romantic, constructionist and transformative) and how these different conceptualisations of the genre might influence a researcher’s reasons for interviewing. In chapter two, we exemplify a number of these ways of thinking about interviews with reference to our case study. In the next section of this chapter, we consider some ways of interviewing and analysing interview data. </p>

                    <p>Finally, in this section, we briefly point to two other ways of thinking about the use of interviews, both of which are extensions of a transformative approach. The first way uses interviews to achieve de-colonising aims (for example, avoiding using terms that are not relevant or welcomed by the participants, not claiming knowledge about ‘others’, and providing space for participants to reflect on and use their peers’ accounts of their experiences) (see for example, Bartlett et al, 2007). The second way draws on new materialist ideas about the relationships between the interviewee’s contribution and the material aspects of the situation in which the interview takes place (including, for example, interviewer, recording devices, place, time, assumption about possible audiences). We come back to these ‘new’ ways in chapter 5, when we speculate on possible ways out of the (binary) categorisation of interviews as either research instruments or interviews as social practice. </p>

              <h3>Transcription</h3>
              <p>In this section, we ask you to think about how transcription is a precursor to, and an inseparable part of, analysis.  </p>
              <p>While you are reading the extract below, think back to your experience of transcription in earlier parts of these materials. Did transcription feel like a mechanical or a creative process? Were you always sure how to transcribe your recording? When you weren’t sure how to transcribe something, what did you do? How did you decide what to NOT to transcribe? What are the main differences between the spoken text (the recording) and the written text (the transcription)? </p>

                  <h3>Transcribing spoken data </h3>
                  <p>Researchers often talk about making choices about interviewing styles but rarely about the types and levels of transcriptions used when they write out their data. Wetherell (2003:29) reminds us to pay attention to these choices, saying that 'transcription constructs what the data is'. Although the primary data for this study were audio recordings, transcription was essential in order to be able to report the data to our clients and to help us begin to think about research question two. As Heath and Luff say (1993, p. 309, cited in ten Have, 2007, p. 96),  </p>

                  <blockquote>The process of transcription…provides the researcher with a way of noticing, even discovering, particular events, and helps focus analytic attention on their socio-interactional organisation. </blockquote>

                  <p>The choices that we made about the types and levels of transcription of our data included: the level of detail of the transcription (for example, whether or not to note non-verbal communication), what style of orthography to use (‘I won’t’ versus ‘I will not’), and the use of punctuation (see Mann, 2016). In the end, we used two types of transcription: verbatim transcription, as requested by the client, and some of the transcription conventions associated with conversation analysis, as developed by Gail Jefferson (Jefferson, 2004). </p>

                  <p>Our verbatim transcription is content-focused and uses a limited number of transcription symbols, mainly to capture pauses, overlaps and additional information such as laughter. The verbatim transcription was requested by the client and is used to assist the thematic analysis of the data for the first research question. Our approach to transcription also acted as a route towards noticing interactionally ‘interesting’ features/extracts, to be used in the conversation analysis (Silverman, 2017). </p>

                  <p>We used transcription of the interviews as a key ‘noticing device’ (ten Have, 2007:97). The Jeffersonian system of symbols we (partially) adopted aims to tread a middle way between a phonetic transcription (accurate, but difficult to read without a great deal of familiarity with the international phonetic alphabet and very consuming of space on the page) and a content-focussed transcription (easy to read, but not at all an accurate representation of how the interactants are speaking) (ten Have, 2007). The result of this compromise is a style of transcription that, we hope, provides an idea of how the interactants are actually speaking whilst still being fairly readable. There is no rule book for this ‘middle way’, and different users of Jefferson's system use slightly different sets of symbols, or develop new symbols to represent the features of spoken interaction of interest to them; see Appendix A for a list of symbols used in the transcripts of the data collected for this study. </p>

              <p>The four-part framework we outlined about is just a convenient way of sorting our ideas into categories, so that we can easily describe what we think are the main relationships between some different reasons for interviewing. However, we don’t mean to imply that this framework is the only way of sorting ideas. We also want to acknowledge that we have probably over-emphasised the differences between these approaches, in order to make them easier to describe. We also want to think carefully about the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches, or combinations of approaches. Finally, we want to stress the importance of talking to our ‘clients’ about reasons for doing interviews; in order to align our expectations with theirs, or as a way of clarifying and accepting our differences. </p>

              <p>While you are reading the extract from chapter five, the final chapter, of our book, think about your own position. Do you think that differences in ideas about the purpose of an interview are, potentially, a problem or a resource? Why? In what circumstances? </p>

                  <h3>Bringing neo-positivist/romantic, constructionist and transformative perspectives together </h3>
                  <p>The ‘two different cultures’ of interviews as research instruments for finding out what participants think/know, and interviews as research topics/co-constructions (Van den Berg et al. 2003:5), are not necessarily as far apart as they may seem, or, indeed, as we may have presented them in chapter one of this book. At least in applied linguistics, both thematic analysis and conversation analysis may, depending on the aims of the research project, have a useful part to play, depending on the needs of our client and the importance of a pragmatic approach to meeting these needs. We would not want to use ‘pragmatism’ as a reason for not thinking very carefully about our choices, however. Indeed, we hope that in this book we were able to demonstrate the importance of paying attention to the theories of interviewing when conducting qualitative applied linguistics studies, as suggested by Talmy (2010: 143), </p>

                  <blockquote>there is considerable need for heightened reflexivity about the interview methods that applied linguistics researchers use in their studies, on the role of the interviewer in occasioning interview answers, on the subject 'behind' the interviewee, on the status ascribed to interview data, and on how those data are analyzed and represented, regardless of whether one opts to conceive of interviews as research instrument, or research interviews as participation in social practices. </blockquote>

                  <p>Given that the work of applied linguists is based on solving real-world, language-related problems, it seems likely that we will come across a variety of perspectives on language and communication, as well as on ‘reality’, knowledge, and society. These perspectives will, inevitably, result in a range of different ideas about how to do research, what the research findings mean, and how they can/should be used. As the case study reported here shows, our client approached the aims and uses of the interviews from a ‘romantic’ perspective, whereas as applied linguistics, we were more closely aligned with constructionist ideas about interview data. Based on our experiences during this study, we tentatively suggest that applied linguists engage in an open dialogue with clients, with caution, but without abandoning their own theoretical beliefs. Our position may differ from the experience of other researchers. Mazeland and ten Have (1996), for example, describe how they had to, reluctantly, leave their ‘comfortable’ position of what they describe as 'ethnomethodological indifference', in order to engage in debate with interviewers who were not linguists. Perhaps this is a difference between applied linguists and researchers in other disciplines, including linguistics. Given that the applied linguist’s job is to focus on recognising real-world problems in which there are language-related issues and/or to respond to the identification of a problem by a potential client (Hall et al, 2017), we are used to the idea of collaboration and negotiation with different perspectives, and do not see these processes as obstructive of our research, but as an essential and interesting part of it. </p>

                  <h3>Our final reflections </h3>
                  <p>In the final section of our book we ask ourselves a question ‘so what?’. It is a question that provides an end to our study; a chance to summarise what we have learned and reflect on the significance of this learning. It also helps us to think about what we might have done differently and what we could do next. </p>

                  <p>We have learned that interviews look so familiar that they have almost become invisible as a cultural construct. Their framing and constraining effects, on relationships and identities/personal histories, are so familiar to us as to be un-remarkable. It is the job of applied linguists to point out that interviews are an opportunity for a story to be projected or constrained/rejected; a site of creative struggle, of innovation and destruction. We should demonstrate the delicate mechanisms through which this struggle takes place, including the effects of repetition, silence, overlap and the many other features we described in chapter four of this book. </p>

                  <p>In accordance with Rapley (2019) we have attempted to show that when using interviews as research instruments, equal attention and analytic consideration needs to be applied to, </p>

                  <blockquote>pre- and post- interview talk, to moments of sampling, recruitment and consent, to the preparation of and adjustments to interview guides, and most importantly, to recover the different times, spaces and places, of the 'desk work' for doing analysis on interviews' (Rapley 2019: 282). </blockquote>

                  <p>We have learned that the clients of applied linguists, and the participants on our research, may have very different ideas about the aims of research and the meaning/use of data. These differences are interesting, and need to form part of the research process as we work out what we all mean by familiar concepts/acts such as ‘question’, ‘home’, ‘value’ and so on. Not taking the time to work out how we conceptualise these aspects of ‘common sense’ is a missed opportunity for collaboration and depletes the value of the research findings.  </p>

                  <p>We have learned that it is possible to do research on interviews that treat the interaction both as content (a neo-positivist or romantic conceptualisation of the interview) and discourse (a constructionist or transformative approach). And that these approaches do conflict with each other conceptually, but, very importantly, that this conflict can provide a good way in to an ontologically-aware type of public engagement that is typical of applied linguistics. </p>

                  <p>We have learned that people are not just ‘themselves’ (a neo-positivist/romantic assumption), and don’t only exist in relation to each other (a constructionist assumption), but that they also ‘intra-act' (Barad, 2007) with material things, including inorganic objects (such as a recording device, a car), technologies (such as a transcription code, music) and non-human organisms (such as pets and plants).  </p>

                  <p>We have learned that what seemed like binary categories: one versus another, interviewer versus interviewee, content versus discourse, academic versus public are actually fluid, dynamic concepts that are continually emerging in interaction as a result of what people think ‘is’, what they think they know, and what they believe is fair (see Toohey, 2019). Instead of defending our territory (be that a place, a familiar generalisation, a research method, or an institution), we could open up ourselves, and our clients and research participants, to the infinite undoing of endings/conclusions and therefore the possibility of new histories. We could acknowledge the transformative power of ‘just’ observing. And we could point to our interconnectedness and therefore the importance of our obligations to each other. </p>

                  <p>We have also discovered that York has ‘hidden’ diversity, in a variety of respects, and that improving awareness of difference is probably a way of becoming comfortable with difference, rather than feeling threatened by it, or threatened by other peoples’ fear of it. On the other hand, the opportunity to tell our ‘own’ story is often welcomed and the aspects of our story that we may like to stress are those that we think differ from other stories. There is always a tension between wanting to be ‘ourselves’ and wanting to be part of something else. Story-telling is one way of constantly negotiating that tension, against the constantly changing backdrop of the city, as it exists in ‘reality’ and in our minds. </p>

                  <p>What we could have done differently and what we could do next are the same thing. We could have built in an evaluation phase in to the research. On the other hand, when we set off on this project, we didn’t anticipate that a series of recommendations for community project interviews would be an outcome of our research. It was probably an error of planning not to assume that something would come out of our study that would need testing with the help of our client. So, next, we would like to design a new study that looks at the effectiveness of awareness-raising activities for interviewers, and that also works with ‘hidden’ individuals and groups to collaborate on ways of them telling their stories. </p>
