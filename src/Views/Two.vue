                  <h3>Commumnity build</h3>
                  <p>The community project that formed the basis of our study was initiated as a response to research commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s York Grants Committee in 2010. The research aimed to give a more accurate picture of York's Black, Asian and M inority Ethnic population, and to make related recommendations to local authorities. The results of the research revealed that York's population was much more diverse than had previously been suggested; identifying 78 different minority first languages spo ken in the City and estimating the minority ethnic population at approximately eleven per cent of York's total population. This figure was higher than that suggested by the 2001 census, in which only 2.1 per cent of respondents identified themselves as not White or White other, and 4.9 per cent as not White British, a much lower percentage than the UK average. These results were confirmed by statistics published from the 2011 census, which confirmed that 90.2 per cent of York’s population identified themsel ves as White British. In the report on their research, Craig et al emphasised the need for York to strengthen its commitment to racial equality and diversity, with a view to making a positive impact on the lives of ethnic minority groups in the City.</p>
                  <p>The Centre for Global Education York, the initiators of the community project that provides the case study explored in this book, is a charity that works with the local community to offer support and training aimed at developing understanding of global issues. More specifically, it ‘aims to provide support, challenge, training and learning opportunities that allow interactive involvement with a variety of global educational projects and events’ (Centre for Global Education York, 2014). The Centre has been runni ng for more than thirty years, and for the past twenty years has been based at York St John University. As a ‘not - for - profit organisation’, it is overseen by a group of voluntary directors, and its work is delivered by self - employed associates who manage g rant - funded projects (Centre for Global Education York, 2014). The work of the Centre is mainly carried out in local schools, colleges and universities. In 2012 - 14, the Centre engaged with a wider audience through the community - based York’s Hidden Stories project, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Comic Relief, Community York, and York St John University.</p>
                  <p>The York’s Hidden Stories project was a response to the research, cited above, that emphasised the need for York to strengthen its commitment to racial equality and diversity (Craig et al. , 2010). The aim of the project was to capture and share the stories of York’s Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic residents, and involved fifteen participants who were interviewed about their experiences of moving to, and living in, York. On completion of the project, the project leaders’ evaluation suggested that their project had, ‘recorded, shared and celebrated the cultural heritage of York’s unseen and often unknown multicultural community that could result in disadvantage', noting that, ‘these individuals (the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic participants) were trained to impart their unique cultural memories and experiences which are now part of York’s Community’</p>
                  <p>The data that was used in our study consists of audio recordings of semi - structured interviews that were collected by the Centre for Global Education York as part of the York’s Hidden Stories project. In total, there are fifteen interviews in which one interviewee and two project leaders participate . Each interview lasts approximately one hour. Each participant was asked the same set of questions, see chapter three – Methodology, covering general information about the participant, their values, their life in their country of origin, and the changes t hey may have experienced since coming to York. The interviews aimed to provide an insight into peoples’ memories of their ‘home’ countries, and their experience of moving to and living in York.</p>
                  <h3>The data</h3>
                  <p>The case study used data collected by the Centre for Global Education as part of the York’s Hidden Stories project and consisted of fifteen semi - structured interviews, conducted by two project leaders who were both present at each interview, with the fifteen project participants. All the participants had been living in York for between two and fifty years, and had originally come to York from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean or Europe.</p>
                  <p>The project participants took part in the York’s Hidden Stories project through a series of workshops over th e course of six months. During that time the participants ‘were trained to impart their unique cultural memories and experiences which are now part of York’s Community’ (Centre for Global Education York, 2014). Towards the end of the community project, the participants were interviewed by the project leaders. Each participant was asked the following set of twenty - five questions (and some were asked additional questions):</p>

                    <li>Has living in York helped you to overcome certain barriers?</li>
                    <li>Do you think in your home country that there are barriers that people have to overcome that are different or the same as for people in the UK?</li>
                    <li>In five years’ time, where do you think you will be in life?</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>Most of the project participants, and both i nterviewers, were multi - lingual. All the interviews were conducted in English and audio recorded. The length of the recordings is outlined in a table below.</p>

                  <p>It is important to note that the interviewees and interviewers were already familiar with each other prior to the interviewing, given that the interviewers had had a chance to build relationships with their interviewees over the course of six months of wor kshops and events. Garton and Copland (2010) refer to these types of interviews, where there is a prior relationship between interviewers and interviewees, as 'acquaintance interviews'. They stress that a prior relationship, or lack of one, can have a prof ound effect on the data that gets generated in interview talk, and suggest that participants of acquaintance interviews should be made aware of the impact a prior relationship may have on the interaction. Mann (2016) argues that familiarity can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Where the interviewer enters in to the interaction in the hope of achieving a deeper understanding of their interviewee’s perspective (what we describe in chapter one as a ‘romantic’ assumption), it can help them to feel bette r able to understand what the interviewee ‘really means’. Where the interviewer enters in to the interaction with a neo - positivist perspective, familiarity may feel like a disadvantage, in the fear that they will be encouraged to engage with their intervie wee’s responses through the lens of their own prior experiences. For researchers who enter into an acquaintance interview with a constructionist perspective, familiarity is neither an advantage or a disadvantage, but an inevitable feature of all interactio n that is to be noted (and perhaps studied, as part of the analysis of the interview data)</p>

                  <p>We assume, but can’t be sure, that the leaders of the community project that resulted in the fifteen interviews built relationships with the participants through workshop and events in the six months prior in order to deliberately create ‘acquaintance’ interviews, with a view to achieving a deeper ‘understanding’ of the stories that were generated. It may be the case, however, that the project leaders built these r elationships simply in order to create longer answers, generating more data for analysis, or that they saw the six months of workshops and events held prior to the interviews as a separate stage of the project, with no consequences for the interviews. It i s also possible, that the project leaders were aware of the transformative power of interviews; aiming to use their interview data and any discussion of their findings to benefit the project participants, by raising awareness of aspects of their lives or c hallenging interpretations of their experience in order to change the attitudes of their fellow residents of the City of York.</p>
                  
                  <p>Given that we are now unable to ask our clients about their rationale for the design of their project, we would advise other app lied linguists (including ourselves in future) to discuss the design of a project before it begins, so that project leaders, participants and researchers are, as far as possible, aware of the assumptions behind, and the consequences of, their decisions fro m the very start.</p>

              <ul class="tasks">
                <li>The interview should last approximately 15-20 minutes. However, it is importable to give yourself and your participant extra time to get comfortable and make sure your recording equipment is set up.  </li>
                <li>Arrange for you and your interviewee to be in a quiet and comfortable place for the time of the interview to minimise any interruptions.  </li>
                <li>Turn off or mute your mobile phone and ask your interviewee to do the same. </li>
                <li> If you are using your computer to interview and record, close all extra programs — particularly any Internet browser windows or streaming media. You don’t want any unnecessary and distracting notifications. </li>
                <li>Consider doing a double recording of the audio on your phone, you can download free Voice Recorder apps on IOS or Android. </li>
                <li> If you can, use a hard-wired Internet connection (rather than a wifi connection), as it limits any degradation of the signal. </li>
                <li>If you aren't able to use a hard-wired connection, you can sit as close to the wifi router as possible.</li>
                <li>When you have finished the interview, save it onto the York St John OneDrive, so that you can access it on any device and be sure that the data is stored securely. You can then delete the interview file from all other device</li>
