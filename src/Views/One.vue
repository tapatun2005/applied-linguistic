              <h3>Things to prepare before interview</h3>
              <ul class="tasks">
                <li>The interview should last approximately 15-20 minutes. However, it is importable to give yourself and your participant extra time to get comfortable and make sure your recording equipment is set up.  </li>
                <li>Arrange for you and your interviewee to be in a quiet and comfortable place for the time of the interview to minimise any interruptions.  </li>
                <li>Turn off or mute your mobile phone and ask your interviewee to do the same. </li>
                <li> If you are using your computer to interview and record, close all extra programs — particularly any Internet browser windows or streaming media. You don’t want any unnecessary and distracting notifications. </li>
                <li>Consider doing a double recording of the audio on your phone, you can download free Voice Recorder apps on IOS or Android. </li>
                <li> If you can, use a hard-wired Internet connection (rather than a wifi connection), as it limits any degradation of the signal. </li>
                <li>If you aren't able to use a hard-wired connection, you can sit as close to the wifi router as possible.</li>
                <li>When you have finished the interview, save it onto the York St John OneDrive, so that you can access it on any device and be sure that the data is stored securely. You can then delete the interview file from all other device</li>
